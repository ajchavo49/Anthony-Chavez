   <p1> I genuinly like to brew honey wine you come to find out there is alot that goes into it Sciantifically and practically, From the selection of honey the type of yeast you use can all be factored in. Its a very simple beverage to make but to make mead interesting its good to be creative. But to make it correctly measurment is important. the whole process requires an even balance of qualitative and quantatative aspects to produce a good honey wine.</p1>

<h3>Weekly Reflections</3>

<h3>Week 1</h3>
<p>During the first week in the class we began working on our first project which was building a prototype board game, the class acheived this by breaking up into teams, Later in the week each team played and reviewed each others game. We were then approached by our class leader Rod with a proposal to encorperate VR into a local buisiness while the project was successfull the team that worked on the video APP that utilized our VR project won 2nd place for their app.</p>
<h3>Week 2</h3>
<p>As this week progressed I am begining to see that this program thrives off of creative freedom, In digital media you are given the tools and are aloted the oportunity to practice using the tools you were given to produce a project that can be creative and at times frustrating.</p>
